=head1 VERSION

This document describes Path::Class::Each version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Path::Class;
  use Path::Class::Each;

  ## Files ##

  # Iterator interface
  my $iter = file( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
  while ( defined( my $line = $iter->() ) ) {
    print "Line: $line\n";
  }

  # 'next' interface
  my $file = file( 'foo', 'bar' );
  while ( defined( my $line = $file->next ) ) {
    print "Line: $line\n";
  }

  # Callback interface
  file( 'foo', 'bar' )->each(
    sub {
      print "Line: $_\n";
    }
  );

  ## Directories ##
  
  # Iterator interface
  my $iter = dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
  while ( defined( my $file = $iter->() ) ) {
    print "File: $file\n";
  }

  # 'next' interface
  my $file = dir( 'foo', 'bar' );
  while ( defined( my $file = $dir->next_file ) ) {
    print "File: $file\n";
  }

  # Callback interface
  dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->each(
    sub {
      print "File: $_\n";
    }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Path::Class::Each> augments L<Path::Class::File> and
L<Path::Class::Dir> to provide three different ways of iterating over
the lines of a file and three ways of iterating the files recursively
contained in a directory.

C<Path::Class::File> provides a C<slurp> method that returns the
contents of a file (either as a scalar or an array) but has no support
for reading a file a line at a time. For large files it may be desirable
to iterate through the lines; that's where this module comes in.

C<Path::Class::Dir> provides C<children> which returns the files and
directories immediately contained in a directory but does not expose a
'find' interface to recursively search a directory. This module provides
iterators that visit all the files in the directory tree below a
directory.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 File Iterators

=head3 C<< Path::Class::File->iterator >>

Get an iterator that returns the lines in a file. Returns C<undef> when
there are no more lines to return.

  my $iter = file( 'foo', 'bar' )->iterator;
  while ( defined( my $line = $iter->() ) ) {
    print "Line: $line\n";
  }

If the file can not be opened an exception will be thrown (using
C<croak>).

The following options may be passed as key, value pairs:

=over

=item C<< chomp >>

Newlines will be trimmed from each line read.

=item C<< iomode >>

Passed as the C<mode> argument to C<open>. See
L<Path::Class::File::open> for details. If omitted defaults to 'r'
(read-only).

=back

Here's how options are passed:

  my $chomper = file('foo', 'bar')->iterator( chomp => 1 );

=cut

sub Path::Class::File::iterator {
  my $self = shift;
  my @opt  = @_;

  croak "each requires a number of name => value options"
   if @opt % 2;

  my %opt   = ( @opt, iomode => 'r' );
  my $mode  = delete $opt{iomode};
  my $chomp = delete $opt{chomp};

  croak "Unknown options: ", join ', ', sort keys %opt
   if keys %opt;

  my $fh = $self->open( $mode ) or croak "Can't read $self: $!\n";
  return sub {
    my $line = <$fh>;
    return unless defined $line;
    chomp $line if $chomp;
    return $line;
  };
}

=head3 C<< Path::Class::File->next >>

Return the next line from a file. Returns C<undef> when all lines have
been read.

Internally L<iterator> is called if necessary to create a new iterator.
The same options that L<iterator> accepts may be passed to C<next>:

  my $file = file( 'foo', 'bar' );
  while ( defined( my $line = $file->next( chomp => 1 ) ) ) {
    print "Line: $line\n";
  }

=head4 NOTE

It may be tempting to use an idiom like:

  # DON'T DO THIS
  while ( my $line = file('foo')->next ) {
    ...
  }

That will create a new C<Path::Class::File> and, therefore, a new
iterator each time it is called with the result that the first line of
the file will be returned repeatedly.

=head3 C<< Path::Class::File->each >>

Call a supplied callback for each line in a file. The same options that
L<iterator> accepts may be passed:

  file( 'foo', 'bar' )->each( chomp => 1, sub { print "Line: $_\n" } );

Within the callback the current line will be in C<$_>.

=head2 Directory Iterators

=head3 C<< Path::Class::Dir->iterator >>

Return an iterator that returns each of the files in and below a
directory.

By default only files are returned. The following options may be
supplied to modify this behaviour:

=over

=item C<< dirs >>

Return directories as well as files.

=item C<< no_files >>

Return directories only.

=back

=cut

sub Path::Class::Dir::iterator {
  my ( $self, @opt ) = @_;

  croak "each requires a number of name => value options"
   if @opt % 2;

  my %opt      = @opt;
  my $dirs     = delete $opt{dirs};
  my $no_files = delete $opt{no_files};

  my @queue = $self->children( @opt );
  return sub {
    TRY: {
      return unless @queue;
      my $obj = shift @queue;
      if ( $obj->isa( 'Path::Class::Dir' ) ) {
        unshift @queue, $obj->children( @opt );
        redo TRY unless $dirs || $no_files;
      }
      else {
        redo TRY if $no_files;
      }
      return $obj;
    }
  };
}

=head3 C<< Path::Class::Dir->next_file >>

Return the next file from a recursive search of a directory. Returns
C<undef> when all lines have been read.

Internally L<iterator> is called if necessary to create a new iterator.
The same options that L<iterator> accepts may be passed to C<next_file>:

  my $dir = dir( 'foo', 'bar' );
  while ( defined( my $file = $dir->next_file ) ) {
    print "File: $file\n";
  }

=head3 C<< Path::Class::Dir->next_dir >>

Return the next directory from a recursive search of a directory.

=cut

sub Path::Class::Dir::next_dir { shift->next_file( no_files => 1 ) }

=head3 C<< Path::Class::Dir->each >>

Call a supplied callback for each file in a directory. The same options
that L<iterator> accepts may be passed:

  dir( 'foo', 'bar' )->each( sub { print "File: $_\n" } );

Within the callback the current file will be in C<$_>.

=head3 C<< Path::Class::Dir->each_dir >>

Call a supplied callback for each subdirectory in a directory.

=cut

sub Path::Class::Dir::each_dir { shift->each( no_files => 1, @_ ) }

BEGIN {
  my @extend = qw( Path::Class::File Path::Class::Dir );
  for my $class ( @extend ) {
    no strict 'refs';
    *{"${class}::each"} = sub {
      my ( $self, @opt ) = @_;
      my $cb   = pop @opt;
      my $iter = $self->iterator( @opt );
      while ( defined( local $_ = $iter->() ) ) { $cb->() }
    };
    my $next = $class eq 'Path::Class::Dir' ? 'next_file' : 'next';
    *{"${class}::${next}"} = sub {
      my $self = shift;
      $self->{_iter} = $self->iterator( @_ ) unless $self->{_iter};
      my $line = $self->{_iter}->();
      delete $self->{_iter} unless defined $line;
      return $line;
    };
  }
}
